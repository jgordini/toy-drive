UAB IT has multiple ways to give to the annual UAB Toy Drive this year both in-person and virtual.

Toy Drive collection boxes will be stationed in buildings across campus, and you can also ship a new, unwrapped toy for the UAB Toy Drive.

UAB IT has set up wish lists at [<span class="underline">Target</span>](https://www.target.com/gift-registry/giftgiver?registryId=6a09bc1b94c6442186b2444b17b1f588&lnk=registry_custom_url) and [<span class="underline">Amazon</span>](https://www.amazon.com/registries/custom/UZABFKXEY40N/guest-view), or you can ship at toy to this address:

> **UAB Toy Drive**
> 506 10th St. South
> AB515
> Birmingham, AL 35233

This year marks the 28th year that UAB will be collecting toys for the U.S. Marines\' Toys for Tots drive. Toys should be delivered to the Administration Building or one of the campus collection boxes by Dec. 16, as pickup will be Dec. 17.
